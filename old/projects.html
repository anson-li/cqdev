<h2>What's Happening at Crude Quality</h2>
      <h3>Western Canadian Crude Quality Monitoring Programs<br></h3><a href="http://www.crudemonitor.ca"><img src="img/crudemonitor.gif" align="middle"></a>

<p align="justify">Crude Quality Inc. has been supplying management and facilities for the Crude Quality Monitoring Programs supported by western Canadian producer community, facilitated by the <a href="http://www.capp.ca">Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers</a>. Detailed monthly data on samples of all Western Canadian heavy crude streams are available at <a href="http://www.crudemonitor.ca" title="Take me to crudemonitor.ca">www.crudemonitor.ca</a>. The data can be accessed as individual batch reports, or as standard analyses, light ends, or simulated distillation summaries, for all crudes and all recent dates. All files can easily be downloaded in .pdf or .xls format. You can also create custom reports in any design you wish. There is a mobile device version of crudemonitor.ca that you can take with you!</p>
<p align="justify">We have added quick charting capability to the website and time charts of commonly requested properties are available in downloadable charts for insertion into reports or presentations.
      <h3>MidStream Quality Testing</h3>
<p align="justify">Crude Quality Inc. has been actively supporting initiatives on the part of the Canadian pipeline companies to harmonize the quality of as-received and as-delivered crude product quality. Proper communication of the quality criteria among all parties involved in the transaction of a commodity crude oil delivery (seller, buyer, carrier) has proven to be essential to the success of improved quality management. Key points for quality in the transportation sector include, but are not limited to, reliability, ratability and commodity consistency.</p>
      <h3>DownStream Quality Testing</h3>
<p align="justify">A significant database of crude quality parameters, as produced, has been developed and is used extensively by every aspect of the oil industry. It has been suggested that the next step in the monitoring program could include collection of data on the "as received" side, for direct comparison with the upstream data. Crude Quality Inc. is working with industry partners, at both corporate and association levels, to assist in the development of a downstream quality database that will provide financial incentives for consistency and ratability.</p>
      <h3>Committee Participation</h3>
<p align="justify">Crude Quality Inc. has made a number of voluntary commitments to active participation on industry committees in both Canada and the United States. Along with our experience base and exposure to crude quality issues in a wide variety of forums, CQI offers a "non-vested" perspective (don't own any oil, never will!!) that has assisted in the building of industry level solutions to crude quality challenges.</p>
