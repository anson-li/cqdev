<h2>Crude Quality Inc. Services</h2>
<p align="justify">At Crude Quality Inc. we are committed to the highest quality standards in our consulting and analytical services. We have negotiated best customer status with all of our suppliers, and pass on these savings to you. All of the laboratory results are run through our customized reporting system to insure that the information that you are receiving is in a format that is compatible and meaningful to your operations.</p>
   <h3><A name="consulting">Consulting Services</A></h3>
<p align="justify">Crude Quality Inc. is available to provide contracted consulting services in the areas of crude quality monitoring, testing protocols and procedures for crude quality, and specialty analytical services related to crude oil and refined products quality. Should you have a concern related to crude oil quality, chances are high that we can help, or put you in contact with someone who could better assist you.</p>
<p align="justify">We have considerable experience presenting perspectives on crude quality issues to large and small groups of interested people. We also offer technical services to link outside data to LP modeling systems.</p>
<p align="justify">Upcoming works in progress include "miniaturization" of crude quality data for ease of transport and quick reference, crude blending simulations, and continuing development of communications between producers, transporters, traders, and refiners of crude oil. Please feel free to contact us to see if we can assist you in your quality efforts!!</p>
<p align="right"><a href="services.html">top</a></p>
   <h3><A name="expert">Expert Witness</A></h3>
<p align="justify">Crude Quality Inc has appeared before utility commissions and arbitration panels to provide expert testimony with respect to crude quality related matters. We are well respected in the Canadian crude oil marketing community, and our research, technical services and opinions have provided enlightened insight into a variety of legal arguments. 
<p align="right"><a href="services.html">top</a></p>
      <h3><A name="contaminants">Contaminant Testing</A></h3>
<p align="justify">In general, contaminants are materials that are inadvertently, or deliberately, added to crude oil supplies. They are usually added to crude supplies for beneficial reasons (eg corrosion inhibitors, organic chlorides, deicing or hydrate prevention, dispersants in pipelines, ...). Unfortunately, these additives can have negative effects on downstream processes.</p>
<p align="justify">The Canadian and US Crude Quality Technical organizations have invested significant time and effort into the field of crude oil contamination. The Crude Oil Quality Association (COQA) have posted <a href="http://coqa-inc.org/Additive%20Survey.pdf">information on the Internet</a> from their meetings regarding the subject of crude contamination.</p>
<p align="justify">Contaminants can create havoc in the refining of crude oil. They have been known to interfere with the processing of crude oil by disrupting desalting, poisoning catalysts, fouling treater systems, etc. They can also interfere with the certification testing of the finished products. </p>
<p align="justify">Determining of the presence of a contaminant in crude or in refined products (qualitative testing), and/or determining the exact concentration of an exact contaminant in crude or in refined products (quantitative testing), usually requires the application of highly specialized techniques to specific circumstances. As such, we recommend that you contact us directly by phone, fax or by <a href="mailto:crudequality@gmail.com?subject=Contaminant testing">e-mail</a>.</p>

   <h3><A name="assays">Crude Assays</A></h3>
<p align="justify">Crude Oil Assays are designed to evaluate whole crude oils and various boiling range fractions contained within the crude oil.The information obtained from the assay can be used for detailed engineering and marketing purposes. An assay can be customized to meet specific requirements.</p>
<p align="justify">A crude oil assay involves a physical distillation of the crude oil to generate specific boiling range fractions ("cuts"). Each of the cuts is analyzed for physical and chemical properties, and <font color="#000000" size="3">basic or detailed information is provided regarding the whole crude properties and the individual cut qualities.</font></p>
